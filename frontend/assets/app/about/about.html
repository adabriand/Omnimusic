            <p>The Omnimusic (a/k/a <strong>Omni</strong>) was born at january 22, 2013 as a Tumblr page where our
                collaborators could
                share a mix of new/old songs of all genres in one place. The Omni's interface on its first year enabled
                visitors to discover songs through a radio player, search and by a carefully organized set of genre
                tags. Unfortunately, a digital rights owner has forbidden the stream of some songs and, consequently,
                the Tumblr had to take down the page.</p>
            <p>
                One year later, we've decided to revive the project as a new and independent website with the same goals
                of the previous version. Furthermore, we've planned to add some playlists features to enhance the users'
                experience while they're discovering songs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This version is an alpha one. We're incrementally adding small features and testing UI designs until we
                achieve a enjoyable experience that we desire for our users. If you want to know more about the code on
                development, you can access it <a href="https://github.com/adabriand/omnimusic" target="_blank"> on
                GitHub</a>. The project's code is currently under GPLv3 license, meaning you can freely re-use it and
                change it.
